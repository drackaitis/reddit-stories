# Reddit Stories App

This is a prototype web application for reading Reddit threads with minimal visual distractions. It provides read-only access to selected subreddits that focus on people's real-life experiences and troubles.

The purpose of this app was to allow me to learn React and Redux for creating single-page applications and is closely tied to something I like to do, which is reading Reddit stories.

Last changes made in 2022.

## Getting started

The application has been deployed on Netlify.

Click [here!](https://reddit-stories.netlify.app/) to test it out.


## Features

This react-app allows for following actions:

* Read posts from the subreddits /r/AmITheAsshole, /r/relationship_advice and /r/advice
* Read first level replies and the original poster's replies to those
* Select which of the three subreddits to include
* Search for specific posts across all subreddits

## Disclaimer

This react-app is a prototype build meant mostly for private use and as a portfolio project to show that I've worked with React. Keep your expectations low.
